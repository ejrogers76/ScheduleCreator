Schedule Creator
=============================
This program is designed to emulate the basic schedule creation software used by Jacksonville State University students when registering for classes. This program allows for the viewing of specific courses as well as adding these courses to a trial schedule. The program also has built-in contradiction detection, should two desired courses have overlapping time slots.

This program was completed as an assignment in CS 232. The assignment was to introduce and fortify the use of multiple classes in object oriented programming. The project is the single largest program I personally have worked on to date consisting solely of code I have written myself.

The program was completed fully in the Fall of 2017 in Java using the Netbeans IDE.

Usage
=============================
The program itself is self explanatory, guiding the user through the various menus. Some knowledge of the courses available is required and not all available courses are included with the program itself. To implement a more complete list of courses or an updated course list, simply open the main folder, remove the file named "courseList" and replace it with the desired file. Before running the program, the new source file should be renamed to "courseList". This should be a csv file or the program will not run as desired.
